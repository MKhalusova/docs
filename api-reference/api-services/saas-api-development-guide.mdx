### Example: Parsing a Document via SaaS API

Please refer to the sample code and output provided below to begin processing documents with your SaaS API.

<Warning>

When using the Command Line Interface (CLI), ensure that you copy the complete SaaS API URL provided in your email. This URL should include the specific path `/general/v0/general`.
</Warning>

```bash
# Make sure to replace the placeholders with the actual URL and API key from your email
# Include the path `/general/v0/general` in the URL.

curl -X 'POST' 'https://<REPLACE WITH THE URL IN THE EMAIL>'
     -H 'accept: application/json'
     -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data'
     -H 'unstructured-api-key: <REPLACE WITH API KEY IN THE EMAIL>'
     -F 'files=@sample-docs/family-day.eml'

```


![Sample Output](https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured/_images/sample_output.png)

Or, you can use [partition\_via\_api](https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured/core/partition.html#partition-via-api) to access the SaaS API URL.

```bash
from unstructured.partition.api import partition_via_api

filename = "example-docs/eml/fake-email.eml"

elements = partition_via_api(
  filename=filename,
  api_key=<<REPLACE WITH YOUR API KEY>>,
  api_url="https://<<REPLACE WITH YOUR SERVER URL>>/general/v0/general"
)
```


<Warning>

When using the Unstructured [Python SDK](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-python-client) or [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-js-client), it is important to **omit** the path `/general/v0/general` from the `server_url` parameter. Additionally, ensure you use `https` in the URL to prevent potential errors.
</Warning>

```bash
from unstructured_client import UnstructuredClient

# Remember NOT to include `/general/v0/general` in the `server_url`
s = UnstructuredClient(api_key_auth="<YOUR_API_KEY>",  # Replace <YOUR_API_KEY> with the API key provided in the email
                       server_url="<YOUR_SERVER_URL>") # Replace <YOUR_SERVER_URL> with the server URL provided in the email

```
